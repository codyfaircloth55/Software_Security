<h2>CS 305 Software Security</h2>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>In this project, Aremis Financial was a fictitious financial institution. They requested encryption implementation on their long-term archive files and secure communications to be established. This would be implemented through a checksum verification function, a generated self-signed certificate, and the conversion of the web-based application from HTTP to HTTPS.</p>
<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<p>In this project, I implemented plugins into the pom.xml file, created certificates, and implemented the checksum verification function very well. Code security is an important aspect of development because everyone expects data privacy. Most organizations and end users expect no vulnerabilities that will leave their sensitive data available to attackers. Secure coding is a way to meet these expectations and give the client peace of mind. Software security allows for an institution to either gain or maintain customer confidence. For example, if a company has software with major vulnerabilities that allow for SQL injections and root access, customer information is easy to steal and the trust in the company diminishes.</p>
<h3>Challenges:</h3>
<p>The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was determining false positives. Most of the vulnerabilities could be alleviated by simply updating the dependency which leads to many false positives. However, knowing what dependencies were out of date was very helpful in this project.</p>
<h3>Approach:</h3>
<p>I increased layers of security in this project by adding an encryption algorithm, adding a self-signed certificate, and implementing HTTPS. The way I would assess vulnerabilities in the future would be a multi-step process. First, I would obtain requirements from the client and implement these requirements. Next, I would run dependency tests to see if any dependencies are out of date and if I added any extra vulnerabilities with my additions. Finally, I would thoroughly test the code to check for functionality, error handling, and encapsulation. I ensured functionality and security in this application through thorough testing. Additionally, It was determined that no new vulnerabilities were introduced through my refactored code by comparing the OWASP dependency test before and after the implementation of new features.</p>
